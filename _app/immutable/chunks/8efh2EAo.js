This is <em>actually</em> a mod of Super Mario 64. This was (at the time of writing) the furthest from Super Mario 64 I’ve ever taken a romhack. It was created over a <em>week</em> (9 days, technically) as part of the Mario Jams: Façade romhacking competition. I worked on it with Mel from Team Cornersoft, where he handled the modeling and I was assigned to the depths of coding.</p> <p>As a bonus for this, we wanted the romhack to be playable on an actual Nintendo 64, and it is! It runs super well, with a few tricks to make rendering a bit easier specifically when it’s on console.</p> <h2>Development</h2> <p>I’m actually super excited to talk about this project because of the <em>many</em> hacks and workarounds that were needed to get this hack to work. Things like moving fruits between levels, getting the movement <em>just</em> right, and other N64 shenanigans.</p> <p>Luckily for us, I actually made quite a large amount of gifs during the development of this hack, all the way from Mario being used, to the moment that I managed to get the drag mechanics down, so let’s dive in!</p> <p><img src="/screenshots/antworks/first-crawl.gif" alt="Screenshot"></p> <h4>Woah… Mario crawl…</h4>',1);function i(t){var a=s();n(16),r(t,a)}const u=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:i,metadata:e},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"}));export{u as _};
