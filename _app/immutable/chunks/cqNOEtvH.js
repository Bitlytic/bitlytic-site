This is <em>actually</em> a mod of Super Mario 64. This was (at the time of writing) the furthest from Super Mario 64 I’ve ever taken a romhack. It was created over a <em>week</em> (9 days, technically) as part of the Mario Jams: Façade romhacking competition. I worked on it with Mel from Team Cornersoft, where he handled the modeling and I was assigned to the depths of coding.</p> <p>As a bonus for this, we wanted the romhack to be playable on an actual Nintendo 64, and it is! It runs super well, with a few tricks to make rendering a bit easier specifically when it’s on console.</p>',1);function s(t){var a=n();i(6),r(t,a)}const u=Object.freeze(Object.defineProperty({__proto__:null,default:s,metadata:e},Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"}));export{u as _};
