## Did you say Super Mario 64?

Yeah! This is _actually_ a mod of Super Mario 64. This was (at the time of writing) the furthest from Super Mario 64 I've ever taken a romhack. It was created over a _week_ (9 days, technically) as part of the Mario Jams: Fa√ßade romhacking competition. I worked on it with Mel from Team Cornersoft, where he handled the modeling and I was assigned to the depths of coding.

As a bonus for this, we wanted the romhack to be playable on an actual Nintendo 64, and it is! It runs super well, with a few tricks to make rendering a bit easier specifically when it's on console


## Development

I'm actually super excited to talk about this project because of the _many_ hacks and workarounds that were needed to get this hack to work. Things like moving fruits between levels, getting the movement _just_ right, and other N64 shenanigans.

Luckily for us, I actually made quite a large amount of gifs of the progress as this hack, all the way from Mario being used, to the moment that I managed to get the fruit mechanics down, so let's dive in!
