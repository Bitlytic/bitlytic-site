## Did you say Super Mario 64?

Yeah! This is _actually_ a mod of Super Mario 64. This was (at the time of writing) the furthest from Super Mario 64 I've ever taken a romhack. It was created over a _week_ (9 days, technically) as part of the Mario Jams: Fa√ßade romhacking competition. I worked on it with Mel from Team Cornersoft, where he handled the modeling and I was assigned to the depths of coding.

As a bonus for this, we wanted the romhack to be playable on an actual Nintendo 64, and it is! It runs super well, with a few tricks to make rendering a bit easier specifically when it's on console.
