## Did you say Super Mario 64?

Yeah! This is _actually_ a mod of Super Mario 64. This was (at the time of writing) the furthest from Super Mario 64 I've ever taken a romhack. 

It was created over a _week_ (9 days, technically) as part of [a romhacking competition](https://romhacking.com/competitions/4a152767-731e-4ea0-a90d-aeb2464f8f40) with Mel from Team Cornersoft, where he handled the modeling and I was assigned to the depths of coding.
