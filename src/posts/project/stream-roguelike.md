## Purpose

I wanted to use this project as a way to show people the start of a project all the through needing many a restructure and refactor. So, I streamed it live, explaining my process, and asking any questions people had along the way. 

Aside from that, I also wanted to try making a basic old school roguelike, so this was a fun excuse to finally do it.

## Focus Areas

Although the overall goal was to make a little game in front of people, I actually had a few different things in mind I wanted to get more practical experience in, those are:

1. Resources
2. Action Pattern
3. Procedural/Random Generation
4.
